With this new method of selecting products, recommendation systems are a popular way for users to sort through millions of songs to find the ones that are customized exactly for them. Recommendation systems cast a direct impact on profitability and customer satisfaction for most businesses today. With the nearly limitless options consumers have for products online, they need some guidance!\n", "\n", "This idea can be represented by a concept called the \"Long Tail,\" which is a set of statistical distributions that have a very long \"tail\" of the distribution, representing many occurrences of low frequency things. In the context of consumer products, there are some products that everyone is going to buy: light bulbs, toilet paper, bread etc. There are also items that are far more obscure: specific toys, sports equipment, movies.

An example of an unpersonalized recommendation would be on YouTube when it recommends the most viewed videos. These are videos that the most people have watched. For the most part, these recommendations aren't too bad. After all, there's a reason why things are popular. This approach, however, is not going to help more niche videos get exposure. It also won't be immensely beneficial to those who have very particular tastes. Of course, there are times when a simple approach like this might be best. An example of a simple popularity recommender working well is with the news. There's a high chance that everyone who visits a news website is going to want to see whatever is the most popular at that moment in time.\n", "\n", "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-recommendation-system-introduction/master/images/news.png\" alt=\"home page of the New York Times\" width=\"900\">\n", "\n", "\n", "Because unpersonalized recommendations are based on the entire user pool, whatever item is the most popular at any given time would be recommended to you, even if it's something you are completely uninterested in. There are so many items that are far too obscure to be the \"most popular\" item that might make someone's day. To make more informed recommendations, personalized recommendation systems make use of big data to ensure that users are getting items tailored towards there personal interests, no matter how niche they are.\n", "\n", "### Personalized Recommendations\n", "\n", "The general problem of personalized recommendation systems can be summarized as:\n", "\n", "\n", "__Given__: \n", "The profile of the \"active\" user and possibly some situational context, i.e. user browsing a product or making a purchase etc. \n", "\n", "__Required__:\n", "Creating a set of items, and a score for each recommendable item in that set\n", "\n", "__Profile__:\n", "\n", "User profile may contain past purchases, ratings in either implicit or explicit form, demographics and interest scores for item features \n", "\n", "> There are two ways to gather such data. The first method is to ask for explicit ratings from a user, typically on a concrete rating scale (such as rating a movie from one to five stars). The second is to gather data implicitly as the user is in the domain of the system - that is, to log the actions of a user on the site.\n", "\n", "\n", "__Problem__:\n", "We want to learn a function that predicts the relevance score for a given (typically unseen) item based on user user profile and context \n", "\n", "\n", "Within personalized recommendation systems there are many different possible algorithms.

If you ever see a banner ad saying \"try other items like this\", it is most likely a content-based recommender system. The advantage of a content-based recommender system is that it is a recommender system that gives the user a bit more information as to why they are seeing these recommendations. If they are on a page of a book they very much like, they will be happy to see another book that is similar to it. If they are told that this book is similar to their favorite book, they're more than likely to get that book. A disadvantage of content-based recommender systems is that they often require manual or semi-manual tagging of each of products. More advanced versions of content-based recommender systems allow for the development of an average of all the items a user has liked. This allows for a more nuanced approach to incorporate more than one item when calculating which items are most similar.\n", "\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["### Collaborative Filtering Systems\n", "\n", "\n", "> __Main Idea__: If user A likes items 5, 6, 7, and 8 and user B likes items 5, 6, and 7, then it is highly likely that user B will also like item 8.\n", "\n", "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-recommendation-system-introduction/master/images/collaborative_filtering.png\" alt=\"collaborative filtering: movies watched by both users indicate that the users are similar, then movies are recommended by one user to another user\" width=\"450\">\n", "\n", "Collaborative filtering systems use a collection of user rating of items to make recommendations. The issue with collaborative filtering is that you have what is called the \"cold start problem.\" The idea behind it is, how to recommend something based off of user activity if you do not have any user activity to begin with! This can be overcome through various techniques. The most important thing to realize is that there is no one best recommendation system technique. In the end, what matters most is what system actually gets people to get recommendations that they will act upon. It might be that on the aggregate, recommending the most popular items is the most cost effective way to introduce users to new products. \n", "\n", "\n", "__The key idea behind collaborative filtering is that similar users share similar interests and that users tend to like items that are similar to one another.__\n", "\n", "While this may not be completely true on every occasion, if we have a large enough dataset, if there are patterns present, they will start to emerge.\n", "Assume there are some users who have bought certain items, we can use a matrix with size $\\text{num_users} * \\text{num_items}$ to denote the past behavior of users.
